Git
	version contorl software(tool)
	
	git Hub
		a leading cloud platform where we can stroe our project
		is implemented in ruby and is under microsoft
		usign git hub we can maintain repositories in cloud platform
		to connect to git hub we need one client software
		we use git as one of the clinet
		there are many client sws like git, gitlab, source tree
		
	Git
		is a client software which allows to communicate with github
		create a repo in github
		create a folder in your pc
		then open git command prompt from there
		do git clone with the repo url (git clone url)
		
	Git commands:
		git init --> initialize git make this folder as git folder
		git add --> add all the untracked files to the git
		git add --a --> to add all modified files at a time
		git branch -M main
		git remote add origin url(github repo url)
		git commit -m "" --> do a commit with an optional message. commit to local repo, to commit staged files to local repo
		git push filename --> pushes the file filename to the repo. FROM LOCAL TO CENTRAL
		git log --> gives all the logs (all the commit history)
		git stash  --> save changes in temp location and make working dierctory clean
		git stash apply --> applying stashed changes to local repo back(get back what you've stashed before)
		git diff filename --> show the difference in the file content from your local to what's commited.
		git status --> gives the status of your local repo(to see staged, unstaged and untracked files)
		git clone -> to clone project from central repo to local system
			staged: eligible for commit
			unstaged: modified but not eligible for commit
			untracked: newly created files.
		git branch --> lists all branches, with * for (current)active branch
		git branch <branch-name>  --> creates a new branch on HEAD (tip of the current branch), doesn't switch to the branch though.
		git switch <branch-name>  --> to switch to a diff branch
		git pull --> to take latest changes from central repo to local repo
		git checkout <filename> --> to replace local file with central repo file
		git clone -b <branchname> <repourl>  --> to clone specific branch.
		git log --patch -1  -> shows you 1 number of logs
		git restore --staged <filename>  -> this will bring back file from staged state to modified state
		git restore <filename>  -> this will bring file to its original state as of in remote repo
		git checkout <branchname>  -> to switch from prev branch to branchname
		git log --oneline --decorate  -> shows where head is pointing currently, also all branches. -a list of snapshots(chnges)
		git push origin <branchname> -> pushes to that particular branch
		git merge <branchname> --> merges both current branch and branchname into current branch
		 
		TO MERGE Branch   --> adds changes in source branch to target branch.
		git checkout targetbranch
		git pull
		git merge sourcebranch
		
		
		
	How to push the existing project to the github
		git init -> inside proj filder
		git status --> check status
		git add --a --> add all the files
		git commit -m "initial commit"
		git branch -M main --> 
		git remote add origin <repo url> --> in config file you can see the repo got added with url
		git push -u origin main --> it will prompt for username and password
		
	Branch
		branches are used to maintian multiple code bases in repository
		to perform parallel development we use branches
		in evry project we will see below branches
			master
			development
			feature
			qa
			uat
			release
		Pull Request mneans merging one branch to other branch
		you can create multiple branches in single repo
		to clone specific branch we've to clone that branch using below commadn
		git clone -b <branchname> <repourl>
		
	Working with branches
		create feature branch from master
		clone feature branch
			git clone -b <branchname> <repourl>
		commit & push changes to feature branch
		create pull request to merge feature branch changes to master branch
		
	Git branches & merge conflicts
		
	BitBucket
		bitbucket is a git-based source code repo hosting service owned by atlassina
		bitbuycket offers both commerical plans and free acocunts with an unlimited number of pvt repos
		bitbucket also uses git as version controle system
		note: by using git bash we can perform operations with bitbucket repo
		
		
	REaltime workflow
		wehen we get new project to develop we ned a repo for that proj
		to create new repo for proj we need to send email to git/bitbucket admin
		admin will create repo and will share the repo url
		in development team any one dev will create project folder structure and packages then he/she will push those files to repo
		all the remaining devs will clone repo and then they will start work in proj
		note: anybody can create branches and pull reqests in repo
